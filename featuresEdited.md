<h3>Changes made to 'To Do' app</h3>
- Created a Switch in a give Detail view controller
- Set the switch to be responsive to feedback from for each to do item - not necessary to hit the save button to change the status of the item
- Edited the table view cell background colors to reflect if an item has been 'Done' (Green) or is still 'To Do' (Red)
- Changed the date format in the table view cell to be easier to read 

<h3>Changes still to be made</h3>
-Would like to get the date to autopopulate the dueDateTextField, and then disappear when editing
